This is a log analyzer for the Remedy Action Request Server.  

The purpose of this thing is to compare client-side logs from two different 
environments, (e.g., dev and prod).  To compare logs, pass the file names as 
parameters from the CLI. Specify a third file name for output, e.g.:

$ python3 compare_logs.py /some_dir/logfile1.txt /some_dir/logfile2.txt /some_dir/output_file.txt
