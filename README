This is a log analyzer for the Remedy Action Request Server.  

The purpose of this thing is to compare client-side logs from two different environments, (e.g., dev and prod).  As of yet, it does NOT compare server-side logs.  Also, the formatting of some of the output could really use some help.

Understanding Output
